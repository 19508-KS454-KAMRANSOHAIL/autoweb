# AutoWeb Requirements
# ====================
# 
# This application uses only Python standard library modules.
# No external dependencies are required.
#
# Standard Library Modules Used:
# - tkinter (GUI framework, included with Python on Windows)
# - ctypes (Windows API access, included with Python)
# - threading (multi-threading support)
# - time (timing functions)
# - random (randomization)
# - logging (logging framework)
# - dataclasses (data structures)
# - enum (enumerations)
# - typing (type hints)
# - datetime (date/time handling)
# - sys (system functions)
#
# Note: Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
# On Windows, Python typically includes tkinter by default.
# If tkinter is missing, reinstall Python with the "tcl/tk and IDLE" option.

# No pip packages required!
